## About our team:

Guardian Technologies is a pioneering force in cybersecurity, dedicated to fortifying digital defenses and ensuring the resilience of organizations against modern cyber threats. With a focus on proactive security measures and innovative solutions, we safeguard digital assets, uphold confidentiality, and preserve the integrity of information systems. Our mission is to empower businesses with the expertise, innovation, and unwavering commitment needed to uphold the highest standards of cybersecurity.

## Current Challenges:
* Create a threat model and perform STRIDE analysis.
* Deploy additional threat detection tools.
* Configure IDS rules for improved detection.
* Observe adversarial actions and collect evidence.
* Implement scripted automation for alerting.

## Proposed Solution:
* Threat Model Development: Collaborate to construct a comprehensive threat model DFD (Data Flow Diagram) to identify potential attack vectors and prioritize defensive measures.

* Enhanced Threat Detection: Deploy additional threat detection tools and monitoring solutions, leveraging the provided Splunk Enterprise (SIEM) and Zeek (NIDS), to increase visibility across the AWS environment.

* Configuration of IDS Rules: Configure and fine-tune IDS (Intrusion Detection System) rules to enhance the defensive posture of the environment, focusing on detecting suspicious network traffic and abnormal behaviors.

* Implementation of Detective Controls: Implement detective controls on the web server hosting SimCorp's web application to monitor for unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities.

* Adversarial Activity Observation: Actively observe adversarial actions and collect evidence of scanning activities, TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and any other indicators of compromise (IOCs) to understand the evolving threat landscape and inform response strategies.

* Scripted Automation for Alerting: Develop and fully implement scripted automation solutions to detect and alert on adversarial activity in real-time, enabling timely response and mitigation efforts.

## Project Goals:
* Construct a comprehensive threat model DFD and perform a STRIDE analysis to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in the AWS environment.

* Deploy additional threat detection and monitoring solutions to enhance visibility and detection capabilities across the environment.

* Configure IDS rules and implement detective controls to improve the defensive posture of the AWS infrastructure, with a focus on protecting key assets such as the web server hosting SimCorp's web application.

* Actively observe and document adversarial actions, collecting evidence of scanning, TTPs, and IOCs to understand the adversary's tactics and inform defensive strategies.

* Develop and implement scripted automation solutions to detect and alert on adversarial activity, enabling proactive response and mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of security incidents.
